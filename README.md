<h2> Things i learned from this project </h2>

1) How to work with fetch api and async data
2) learned to fetch the data from api 
3) also learned to display the fetched data from api and dom implementation.
4) finally learned some intermediate js topics like DOM,fetch,map,filter and many more.

<h2> Things i wish could add more </h2>

1) More refined ui and ux
2) More user interaction for the type of questions and number of questions
